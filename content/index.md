**Computer Science & Mathematics Student | UGA Moorehead Honors College**

> "I enjoy work that involves building and proving concepts, from writing elegant code to deriving mathematical relationships."

## About Me

I'm a student at the University of Georgia studying Computer Science and Mathematics with a focus on the intersection of these fields with computational linguistics. My academic strengths lie in analytical and abstract reasoning, and I'm passionate about fields that demand deep problem-solving.

Currently, I'm involved in:
- **MathCounts Outreach** - Tutoring 3rd grade students in math enrichment
- **DevDogs** - UGA's student-run software development organization
- **Moorehead Honors College** - Pursuing interdisciplinary learning and research opportunities
